# SDC
This is a simple R program to crawl, merge and interpolate the daily closing prices of stock indices and their constituents. 
The program requires the "reticulate" package in R and python software to be installed. 
It is intended for R users to access financial data online in R software, for other functions see https://akshare.xyz/.
In R software, the "." in the concatenation function in python needs to be replaced with "$", for example, function ak.stock_zh_a_daily need be replaced by ak$stock_zh_a_daily.
